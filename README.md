# tree-sitter-cairo

Cairo grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).
This is heavily inspired (copy pasted) from the [rust](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-rust) grammar for tree-sitter.

# Feedback

While is tested with the [cairo compiler repo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo), [openzeppelin cairo contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts) and [alexandria](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/alexandria), some patterns can be missing from those files hence cairo files might be incorrectly/incompletely highlighted. If you run into such a situation please create a minimal example that we can reproduce and open an issue.
